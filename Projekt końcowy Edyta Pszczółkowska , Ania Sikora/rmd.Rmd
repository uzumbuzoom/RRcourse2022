# Introduction

The aim of this report is to present the economy and social conditions in `r params$start_year ` - `r params$end_year `  .

Our analysis will be divided on four areas using the following variables: 


 
* economy:
    + GDP per capita 
    + Export as GDP percent
    + Import as GDP percent
    + RD as GDP percent  - expenses on research and development expressed as % of GDP
    
* Population:
    + population
    + birth rate
    + life expectation by 65
    + life expectation by birth
    
    
* Unemployment:
    + unemployment rate  
    + long term unemployment
    
* Women situation: 
    + fertility rate - number of children born pro 1000 people
    + age at 1st child - mean age of women when giving a birth to 1st child
    + gender pay gap - average difference between the remuneration for men and women who are working expressed in % 

        


The dataset was obtained from  [Eurostat database](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database).

# Topics

## Economy {.tabset}

### Import, export

```{r}
#adding GDP in mld dollars to see its changes across given period

df['GDP_mld_dollars'] = round((df$population* df$GDP.per.capita)/1000000000, 2)


knitr::kable(df[ ,  c('year','GDP_mld_dollars', "GDP.per.capita", "Export.as.GDP.percent", "Import.as.GDP.percent" , "RD.as.GDP.percent" )], caption = "GDP and the indicators dependent on it")
```

From the table below we can conclude, that the GDP in the period `r params$start_year ` - `r params$end_year ` has changed by 
`r round((df$GDP_mld_dollars[df$year == params$end_year] - df$GDP_mld_dollars[df$year == params$start_year])/df$GDP_mld_dollars[df$year == params$start_year]*100, 2) `%.


Taking into account the change of population by `r round((df$population[df$year == params$end_year] - df$population[df$year == params$start_year])/df$population[df$year == params$start_year]*100, 2) `% 
 such a change in absolute GDP corresponds to change in GDP per capita by  `r round((df$GDP.per.capita	[df$year == params$end_year] - df$GDP.per.capita	[df$year == params$start_year])/df$GDP.per.capita	[df$year == params$start_year]*100, 2) `%.

The maximum and minimum export expressed as GDP percent was observed in `r df$year[df$Export.as.GDP.percent == max(df$Export.as.GDP.percent)][1]` and in `r df$year[df$Export.as.GDP.percent == min(df$Export.as.GDP.percent)][1]` respectively.

The maximum and minimum import expressed as GDP percent was observed in `r df$year[df$Import.as.GDP.percent == max(df$Import.as.GDP.percent)][1]` and in `r df$year[df$Import.as.GDP.percent == min(df$Import.as.GDP.percent)][1]` respectively.



 
### Expenses on R&D


```{r}
df$RD_mld_dollars = df$GDP_mld_dollars * df$RD.as.GDP.percent/100
