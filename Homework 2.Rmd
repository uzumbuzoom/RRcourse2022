# ASSIGNMENT 2 (for 30/31.03.2022)

Pick a TV show that had its premieres on TV and thus has some viewership numbers reported on Wikipedia.
E.g. [Suits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Suits_episodes) (see table just above the References)

Then create a short report (you can copy the content from Wikipedia or other pages for this task) that contains, for example:

(do a commit after each step!)

1. A brief description of the show (use _italics_ for names).
2. A photo with the logo or a shot from the show itself.
3. A summary of some basic statistics (e.g. on viewership or ratings).
4. A graph of the viewership over time.
5. A graph of the episode-to-episode (or season-to-season) changes in viewership.
6. A short description of the observed changes that includes inline references to numbers (e.g. the viewership decreased by `insert_calculated_number` between seasons 3 and 5).
7. Make sure your report looks nice -> this time we're mostly interested in the output and not necessarily the codes used to achieve it.
7. `knitr` your report and save it in the relevant folder (RR_Mar_30_31) of your repo. 
8. Commit the changes and push them to Github.
